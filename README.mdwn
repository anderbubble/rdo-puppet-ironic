puppet modules to configure Ironic in an RDO environment

I'm experimenting with OpenStack for use in our HPC environment, which
means that I'm mostly interested in Ironic. We have a Red Hat site
license, so any OpenStack solution would probably favor either RDO or
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform.

These puppet modules are forks of modules from the existing openstack
(rdo?) modules, modified to configure Ironic.

There's an example manifest using the modules at
`manifests/ironic.pp`. This manifest would probably be generated by
`packstack` in an RDO environment.
